# Change Log for Blackbird Dataset


* April 14th: 
    - Renamed camera timestamp files from `video_frame_n_sec_timestamps.txt` to `nSecTimestamps.txt` to match file structure in IJRR Fig 2.
    - Pre-rendered image streams for some sequences are temporarily unavailable due to technical issues. They will be reuploaded shortly.
